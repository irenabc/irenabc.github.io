“Working with Irena has truly transformed my life. I no longer feel overwhelmed by stress, and my resilience has grown significantly. I’ve moved past guilt and feel much stronger and more confident in my ability to handle challenges. I’m genuinely happy and at peace with myself now. Irena created a safe and supportive space where I could heal and grow. I feel incredibly grateful for the positive changes in my life, and I can’t thank her enough for the massive impact she’s had.
