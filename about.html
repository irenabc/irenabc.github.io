                    <h2>Reiki Master Skills</h2>
                    <p>As a Master Reiki Practitioner, I am deeply committed to helping you unlock your natural ability
                        to heal through the gentle, yet powerful energy of Reiki. With years of training and experience,
                        I guide you through a holistic healing process that focuses on restoring balance and harmony to
                        your mind, body, and spirit. Reiki works by channeling universal life energy into your body,
                        allowing the energy to flow freely and remove blockages that may be causing physical, emotional,
                        or mental distress. This simple yet transformative process promotes relaxation, reduces stress,
                        and enhances overall well-being. Whether you are dealing with anxiety, physical discomfort,
                        emotional challenges, or simply need to recharge, I combine my expertise in Reiki with other
                        therapeutic modalities to provide a personalized healing experience. My mission is to help you
                        achieve a sense of peace, clarity, and vitality—empowering you to live your best life.</p>

                <div class="testimonials-grid">

                    <div class="testimonial-cell">
                        <p>"Before working with Irena, my 10-year-old daughter struggled with frequent panic attacks.
                            She would often feel overwhelmed and anxious, which affected her daily life and
                            relationships. As a mother, it was heart breaking to watch her go through this."</p>
                        <p>"After just a few sessions with Irena, we began to notice significant changes. Not only did
                            my daughter's panic attacks stop, but her overall mood improved, and she became noticeably
                            happier. She started feeling more confident, and her interactions with family and friends
                            became more positive and connected"</p>
                        <p>"I'm so grateful for the care and support Irena provided. She has truly made a difference in
                            our lives."</p>
                        <p>— A Grateful Mother</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="testimonial-cell">
                        <p>"I had been struggling with depression for a long time and felt stuck in both my personal and
                            professional life. After years of considering medication, I decided to try a different
                            approach and sought help from Irena. In just six sessions, everything started to change."
                        </p>
                        <p>"Not only did I start feeling better mentally and emotionally, but I also received a
                            promotion at work that I never thought possible. My confidence grew, and I found the
                            strength to build a meaningful relationship, something I had always longed for but couldn’t
                            achieve while struggling with my depression."</p>
                        <p>"What I’m most grateful for is that I didn’t have to resort to medication. Irena’s holistic
                            approach to healing, which combined psychological techniques and energy work, helped me find
                            the balance I needed within myself. I feel like I’ve regained control of my life, and I’m
                            happier than I’ve been in years."</p>
                        <p>"I’m incredibly thankful for Irena’s support—she truly made a lasting difference in my life."

                    </div>

                    <div class="testimonial-cell">
                        <p>"At 59, I had been dealing with persistent knee pain for months, and it was affecting my
                            everyday life. Simple activities, like walking or attending events, became difficult. I had
                            tried various treatments but nothing seemed to work."</p>
                        <p>"Then, I decided to try Reiki with Irena. After just a few sessions, I was amazed by the
                            results. The pain in my knee significantly decreased, and I felt more mobile and at ease.
                            For the first time in months, I was able to attend a family party without
                            discomfort—something I thought would be impossible."</p>
                        <p>"I’m so grateful for Irena’s healing approach. Not only did she help alleviate my knee pain,
                            but I also felt a renewed sense of energy and well-being. It’s incredible how something so
                            gentle can have such a powerful impact"</p>

                        <p>"At 42, I was feeling overwhelmed by stress and struggling with a lack of balance in my life.
                            I had trouble sleeping, and my mind was constantly racing. I decided to try Reiki with
                            Irena, and the results have been life-changing."</p>
                        <p>"After just a few sessions, I felt an incredible shift. I became more calm, balanced, and
                            happy. Reiki helped me release the emotional tension I had been carrying, and I noticed I
                            was sleeping much better at night. I now wake up feeling rested and at peace."</p>
                        <p>"Irena’s approach is gentle yet incredibly powerful. Thanks to her healing work, I feel more
                            grounded and connected to myself. I’m truly grateful for the peace and clarity I’ve found
                            through Reiki with Irena."</p>
